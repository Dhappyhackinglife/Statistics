Summary
1) It divides a function with tiny number that is applied with le-5 apparently to see how the difference of the results of the function changes.
2) This is a Major Branch, which is called differential calculus; The other is integral calculus.
3) This deals with instantaneous rates of change and the slope of curves. 
4) The latter concerns accumulation of quanitites, and areas under or between curves.
5) they are fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well defined limit.

Introduction
1) It measures how the function works in a logical system by the slope btween point to point.
2) function is divided by infinitesimal number to derive the derivetive from function.
3) It is called Differential calclus as well.
4) It is another function from a continous sequence of the movement that is descrived by function.
5) Its main purpose is to find the explaination of changes of something moving.
