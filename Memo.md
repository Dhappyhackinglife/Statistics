1. In null-hypothesis significant testing, the p-value is the probability of obtaining test results of at least as extream as the result acually observed, under the assumbtion that the null-hypothesis is correct.
2. A very small P-value wold be very unlikely under the null-hypothesis.
3. If we state one hypothesis only and the aim of the statiscal test is to see whether this hypothesis is tenable, but not to investigate other sepecific hypotheses, than such a test is called a null-hypothesis.
4. Statistical Significant: A result can reject it.
5. The more independent observations from the same probability distribution one has, the more accurate the test wil be able to determine the mean value and show that it is not equal to 0, but this will also increase the importance       of evaluation the real-world or scientific relevence of this deviation.
6. F-Value Equition.
7. 총확율의 법칙; The law of Total Probability : $P(A)=\displaystyle\sum_{n}P(An)=1$
8. A,B 사건이 연관이 되어 있느 경우 - B가 일어나 상태에서, A가 발생할 확률: $P(A|B)$
9. 연관이 없는 경우 - B가 일어난 상태, A가 발생할 확률:  $P(A) * P(B)$

1. Probability: a branch of mathematics that allows us quantify uncertainty.
2. Set Theory: a branch of mathematics based around the concept of sets. In simple terms, a set is a collection of things.
   Two key rules: 1) Each element in set is distinct. 2) The elements in a set are in no partivular order.
   Define a set, using capital letter. A = {1,2,3,4,5}
   Sets can also contain subsets.
   ex) A={1,2,3}    B={1,2,3,4,5}
   Set A is a subset of set B if all the elements in A exist within B.
3. Experiments and Sample Spaces. In probability, an experiment is somethin that produces observation(s) with some level of uncertainty.
4. A Sameple Point: a simgle possible outcome of an experiment.
5. A Sample Space: the set of all possible sample points for an experiment.
6. An Event: a specific outcome(or set of outcomes) and is a subset of the sample space. 
7. The frequentist definition of probability: If we run an experiment an infinite amount of times, the probability of each event is the proportion of times it occurs; $P(\text{EVENT})=\frac{\text{Number of Times Event Occurred}}{\text{Total Number of Trials}}$
8. Law of large numbers: The more the event occurs, the more the tru probability is calculated precisly.
>Rules of probability
1. Union $(A \ or \ B)$ of two sets encompasses any element that exists in either one or both of them.
2. Inersection $(A \ and \ B)$ of tows encompasses any element that exists in both of the sets.
3. Complement $A^{\mathrm{C}}$ of a set consists of all possible outcomes outside of the set.
>Independence and Dependence
1. Independence: The fact that a event doesn't affect the others.
2. Dependence: The fact that a event depends on the effect of the others.
3. Mutually Exclusive Events: Two events are considered mutually exclusive of they cannot occur at the same time.

- Any events that have a non-empty intersection are not mutually exclusive.
>Addtion Rule: 
1. $P(A\ or\ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\ and\ B)$ because It is included twice in the addition of P(A) and P(B)
2. When it's mutual exclusive $P(A\ or\ B) = P(A) + P(B)$ becuase inersection is empty.
>Conditional Probability: 
1. measures the probability of one event occurring, given that another one has already occurred.
2. Word 'given' with a vertical line
3. Indpendent events $P(A|B) = P(A) and P(B|A) = P(B)$
>Multiplication Rule
1. A and B: $P(A\ and\ B)$ or the probability of the intersection of A and B.
2. General formula: $P(A\ and\ B)=P(A) * P(B|A)$
3. Dependent Events: $P(A\ and\ B)=P(A) * P(B|A)$
>Tree diagram
1. One way to visualize all possible outcomes of a pair of events in a tree diagram.
2. Tree Diagrams have following properties:
   - Each branch represents a specific set of events.
   - The probabilities the terminal branches( all possible sets of outcomes) sum to one.
   - We multiply across braches (using the mutiplication rule) to calculate the probability.
