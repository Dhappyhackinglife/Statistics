1. In null-hypothesis significant testing, the p-value is the probability of obtaining test results of at least as extream as the result acually observed, under the assumbtion that the null-hypothesis is correct.
2. A very small P-value wold be very unlikely under the null-hypothesis.
3. If we state one hypothesis only and the aim of the statiscal test is to see whether this hypothesis is tenable, but not to investigate other sepecific hypotheses, than such a test is called a null-hypothesis.
4. Statistical Significant: A result can reject it.
5. The more independent observations from the same probability distribution one has, the more accurate the test wil be able to determine the mean value and show that it is not equal to 0, but this will also increase the importance       of evaluation the real-world or scientific relevence of this deviation.
6. F-Value Equition.
