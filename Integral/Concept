Intro
1) Two types of integral calculus.
2) Integration: The process of finding the vlaue of an interal, which is refered to the indefinite integral.
3) F is an indefinite intergral of f when f is a derivative of F.
4) The definite Integral inputs a function and outputs a number,
  which gives the algebraic sum of areas between the gragp of the input and the x-axis.
5) Riemann sum; the limit of a sum of areas of rectangles.
